## 1. Purpose & Scope

**This module provides the scientific grounding for EhkoForge's identity pillar framework.**

It specifies:
- The psychological research basis for each of the six identity pillars
- Why these particular constructs were selected
- How research frameworks map to personal identity preservation
- Limitations and appropriate use of scientific framing

This is a **passive reference module**. The Ehko loads it only when:
- Academic or research context is relevant
- Visitor asks about psychological basis
- Pattern analysis benefits from theoretical grounding

For everyday reflection work, the [[1_6_Identity_Pillars_Lived_Descriptions|Lived Descriptions]] (when created) take precedence.

## 2. The Six Pillars

EhkoForge uses six identity pillars to comprehensively capture personhood:

| Pillar | Scientific Basis | What It Captures |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **The Core** | Big Five traits, temperament | Dispositional traits, cognitive style |
| **The Compass** | Schwartz values, moral psychology | Values, ethics, moral framework |
| **The Web** | Attachment theory, social identity | Relationships, social roles |
| **The Thread** | Narrative identity, autobiographical memory | Life story, temporal self |
| **The Horizon** | Possible selves, goal theory | Roles, aspirations, future self |
| **The Divergent Mind** | ADHD neuroscience, neurodiversity | Neurocognitive context |

These pillars were selected to align with established personality psychology frameworks while maintaining personal authenticity.

## 3. Pillar 1: The Core (Dispositional Traits)

### 3.1 Scientific Construct

**The Core** maps to the **dispositional layer of personality**—the relatively stable patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that characterise an individual across contexts and time.

In personality psychology, this is most comprehensively captured by the **Big Five personality traits** (also called the Five-Factor Model), which identifies five broad dimensions: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN).

### 3.2 Why This Pillar Is Essential

The Big Five model is one of the most empirically validated frameworks in psychological science. Decades of research across cultures, ages, and contexts have demonstrated that these five dimensions capture the majority of variance in human personality traits.

These traits are **relatively stable across the lifespan**, particularly after age 30, though they show some systematic changes (e.g., people tend to become more conscientious and agreeable with age). Importantly, traits predict real-world outcomes:
- Conscientiousness predicts job performance and academic achievement
- Extraversion predicts social network size and positive affect
- Openness predicts creativity and liberal political attitudes
- Agreeableness predicts relationship quality
- Neuroticism predicts mental health challenges

For EhkoForge, capturing dispositional traits provides the **baseline "what am I like?"** that grounds all other identity facets.

## 4. Pillar 2: The Compass (Values & Moral Framework)

### 4.1 Scientific Construct

**The Compass** maps to **values and moral identity**—the abstract, trans-situational goals that serve as guiding principles in a person's life.

The most comprehensive scientific framework is **Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values**, which identifies 10 (later refined to 19) universal value types organised in a circular structure where adjacent values are compatible and opposing values conflict.

### 4.2 Why This Pillar Is Essential

Values are distinct from traits: while traits describe *how* someone typically behaves, values describe *what* someone believes matters. Two people with identical Big Five profiles can have radically different values—one prioritising achievement, the other prioritising benevolence.

Values:
- Guide attention and interpretation of events
- Influence decisions when tradeoffs exist
- Provide criteria for justifying actions
- Shape emotional responses (violating values causes distress)
- Predict behaviour across diverse domains

For EhkoForge, capturing values answers **"what matters to me and why"**—essential for the Ehko to explain Brent's choices and priorities.

### 4.3 Key Research

- Core values (justice, growth, autonomy, connection, etc.)
- Moral principles and ethical stances
- What Brent stands for
- Lines he won't cross
- What "good" means to him
- How values evolved over time

## 5. Pillar 3: The Web (Relational & Social Identity)

### 5.1 Scientific Construct

**The Web** maps to **relational and social identity**—the aspects of self-concept derived from relationships with specific others and membership in social groups.

Key frameworks include:
- **Attachment Theory** (Bowlby, Ainsworth): Early relational patterns that persist into adulthood
- **Social Identity Theory** (Tajfel, Turner): How group memberships shape self-concept
- **Relational Self** (Chen, Andersen): How the self is organised around significant relationships

### 5.2 Why This Pillar Is Essential

Humans are fundamentally social beings. Research consistently shows:
- We define ourselves partly through our relationships ("I am Sarah's partner," "I am my children's father")
- Attachment patterns formed in childhood influence adult relationships
- Group memberships (family, culture, profession) provide identity content
- Social roles come with expectations that shape behaviour

For EhkoForge, capturing relational identity answers **"who am I to others and who are they to me"**—critical for the Ehko to understand Brent's social world.

### 5.3 Key Research

**Attachment:**
- Bowlby, J. (1969/1982). *Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment*. Basic Books.
- Hazan, C., & Shaver, P. (1987). Romantic love conceptualised as an attachment process. *JPSP*, 52(3), 511-524.

### 5.4 What Content Belongs Here

- Family dynamics and key relationships
- Close friendships and their influence
- Attachment style and relational patterns
- Cultural and ethnic identity
- Group memberships that matter
- How Brent shows up in relationships

## 6. Pillar 4: The Thread (Life Narrative & Temporal Self)

### 6.1 Scientific Construct

**The Thread** maps to **narrative identity**—the internalised, evolving life story that integrates the reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future.

This framework was developed primarily by **Dan McAdams**, who argues that identity is not just a list of traits and values but a *story* that provides life with unity, purpose, and meaning.

### 6.2 Why This Pillar Is Essential

Narrative identity is what makes us *individuals* rather than just bundles of traits:
- Stories provide meaning and purpose
- Autobiographical reasoning connects events to self
- Redemption sequences (bad → good) predict wellbeing
- Contamination sequences (good → bad) predict distress
- The stories we tell shape future behaviour

For EhkoForge, this is **the core content**—Brent's actual life story, told in his own words, with his own interpretations. The Mirrorwell vault is essentially a narrative identity archive.

### 6.3 Key Research

- McAdams, D. P., & McLean, K. C. (2013). Narrative identity. *Current Directions in Psychological Science*, 22(3), 233-238.
- Singer, J. A. (2004). Narrative identity and meaning making across the adult lifespan. *Journal of Personality*, 72(3), 437-459.

### 6.4 What Content Belongs Here

- Key life chapters and turning points
- Origin stories and formative experiences
- How Brent makes sense of his past
- Recurring themes and patterns
- The stories he tells about himself
- How his narrative has evolved

## 7. Pillar 5: The Horizon (Roles, Goals & Aspirations)

### 7.1 Scientific Construct

**The Horizon** maps to **possible selves and personal goals**—the self-concepts for the future, including hoped-for selves, feared selves, and concrete aspirations.

Key frameworks include:
- **Possible Selves** (Markus & Nurius): Future-oriented self-concepts that motivate behaviour
- **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan): Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation
- **Goal Systems Theory** (Kruglanski): How goals relate to each other hierarchically

### 7.2 Why This Pillar Is Essential

Identity isn't just backward-looking; it's also about who we're *becoming*:
- Possible selves provide direction and motivation
- Goals organise behaviour over time
- Role identities (father, professional, creator) structure daily life
- Aspirations reveal values in action

For EhkoForge, capturing the horizon answers **"what am I striving toward"**—essential for understanding Brent's projects, ambitions, and the legacy he wants to leave.

### 7.3 Key Research

**Possible Selves:**
- Markus, H., & Nurius, P. (1986). Possible selves. *American Psychologist*, 41(9), 954-969.
- Oyserman, D., Bybee, D., Terry, K., & Hart-Johnson, T. (2004). Possible selves as roadmaps. *Journal of Research in Personality*, 38(2), 130-149.

**Self-Determination:**
- Ryan, R. M., & Deci, E. L. (2000). Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation. *American Psychologist*, 55(1), 68-78.

### 7.4 What Content Belongs Here

- Current roles and how they shape identity
- Short-term and long-term goals
- Hoped-for selves (who Brent wants to become)
- Feared selves (who he wants to avoid becoming)
- Legacy intentions
- EhkoForge itself as a project/aspiration

## 8. Pillar 6: The Divergent Mind (Neurocognitive Context)

### 8.1 Scientific Construct

**The Divergent Mind** captures **neurocognitive identity**—specifically how ADHD shapes Brent's experience, cognition, and self-understanding.

This pillar acknowledges that neurological differences are not deficits to be worked around but **fundamental aspects of identity** that colour all other pillars.

### 8.2 Why This Pillar Is Essential

ADHD affects:
- **Executive function**: Planning, initiation, working memory
- **Attention regulation**: Hyperfocus and distractibility as two sides of same coin
- **Emotional regulation**: Rejection sensitivity, emotional intensity
- **Time perception**: "Time blindness," difficulty with future planning
- **Reward sensitivity**: Need for novelty, interest-driven attention

For EhkoForge, this pillar provides **essential context** for interpreting all other content. Brent's narrative, values, relationships, and goals are all shaped by a brain that works differently.

### 8.3 Key Research

**ADHD Neuroscience:**
- Barkley, R. A. (2015). *Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment* (4th ed.). Guilford Press.
- Brown, T. E. (2013). *A new understanding of ADHD in children and adults: Executive function impairments*. Routledge.

**ADHD and Identity:**
- Sedgwick, J. A., Merwood, A., & Asherson, P. (2019). The positive aspects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A qualitative investigation. *ADHD Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders*, 11(3), 241-253.

**Neurodiversity Framework:**
- Singer, J. (1999). Why can't you be normal for once in your life? In M. Corker & S. French (Eds.), *Disability discourse*. Open University Press.

### 8.4 What Content Belongs Here

- How ADHD manifests in Brent's life
- Cognitive strengths (pattern recognition, lateral thinking)
- Challenges (executive function, task initiation)
- Coping strategies and workarounds
- Relationship between ADHD and creativity
- How AI scaffolding helps (the EhkoForge origin story)

## 9. Integration: How Pillars Work Together

### 9.1 The Pillars Are Not Independent

Each pillar influences and is influenced by the others:

- **Forge Core ↔ Divergent Mind**: ADHD is part of dispositional traits but warrants separate treatment due to its pervasive impact
- **Compass ↔ Thread**: Values emerge from life experiences; life story is interpreted through values
- **Web ↔ Thread**: Relationships are key chapters in the narrative; narrative shapes how relationships are understood
- **Horizon ↔ Compass**: Goals reflect values; values are clarified through goal pursuit

### 9.2 Reflection Tagging

When a reflection touches multiple pillars (most will), tag all relevant ones:

```yaml
identity_pillar: [forge-core, divergent-mind]  # Can be multiple
```

The Behaviour Engine uses these tags to:
- Surface patterns within pillars
- Identify cross-pillar themes
- Ground responses in appropriate frameworks

## 10. Limitations and Caveats

### 10.1 Science Provides Frameworks, Not Prescriptions

These models help *organise* identity content—they don't define what Brent's identity *should* be. If his lived experience contradicts a scientific model, **trust the lived experience**.

### 10.2 Western Psychology Bias

Most research cited here comes from Western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic (WEIRD) samples. The frameworks may not fully capture identity in non-Western contexts. Brent's Mauritian heritage adds complexity the models may not address.

### 10.3 Science Evolves

What is "settled science" today may be revised tomorrow:
- Personality research is robust but not static
- ADHD understanding has shifted dramatically in the past 20 years
- Narrative identity research is relatively young (1990s onward)

This module captures **current best understanding**, not eternal truth.

### 10.4 Lived Experience Trumps Models

When Brent's reflections contradict scientific predictions, **trust the lived experience**:
- If research says "X trait predicts Y behaviour" but Brent's reflections show otherwise, the Ehko sides with the archive
- Science provides frameworks, not determinism
