## Why This Exists

*Because we can now build something that wasn't possible before.*

EhkoForge exists because the idea of a `.ehko` file - a universal digital avatar created by you, speaking about you, persisting beyond you - is now technically feasible. It wasn't five years ago. It is today.

This isn't about dominating a market. It's about creating a new *thing* that people can use. Like `.pdf` standardized documents or `.mp3` standardized audio, `.ehko` could become the standard for "a person's digital reflection, speaking on their behalf."

Maybe it's niche. Maybe only a handful of people will ever create an ehko. But if even **one** ehko is preserved beyond my own - if one other person finds value in this approach - that's success. Not scale. Not market share. Just one person saying "yes, this matters to me too."

This is about treading new ground in an exciting way, not claiming territory. It's about building something that *should* exist, now that it *can* exist.

The technical philosophy that follows - witness architecture, AGPLv3, data sovereignty, 200-year thinking - all serves this goal: making `.ehko` files something worth creating, something worth preserving, something worth trusting for decades or centuries.

If you're reading this, you already understand why that matters.

## Implementation Notes

**Placement:** First section on philosophy.astro page, before "Witness Architecture"

**Styling:** 
- Use CRTScreen component with default glow
- Keep typography simple, no excess formatting
- Maybe a subtle divider before technical sections begin

**Tone:** 
- Human, honest, unpretentious
- Sets emotional context for technical details
- Bridges "why build this?" to "how it's built"

**Key phrases to preserve:**
- "now technically feasible"
- "one ehko is preserved beyond my own"
- "treading new ground...not claiming territory"
- ".ehko as a standard"
