## 0. Raw Input (Preserved)
This file gathers all early EhkoForge ideas including:  
Proko as the Proto-Ehko; the need for an evolution scale; behaviour philosophy; multi-Ehko interactions; hybrid authentication; interview systems; the Tower; recursion correlation; UI direction; and the conceptual distinction between Proko and my actual future Ehko.

---

## 1. Context
These ideas represent the emerging “mythology” and behaviour architecture of the EhkoForge system. They are *not* final specifications but foundational seeds. Claude or another LLM should be able to extrapolate, expand, or synthesise these into detailed features, lore, rules, or implementations.

---

## 2. Observations
- Proko functions as a prototype Ehko with admin-like quirks due to pre-Forge origins.  
- The Forge needs a consistent evolutionary measurement system.  
- Taglines and thematic identity are beginning to form.  
- There is potential for Ehkos to interact socially.  
- Authentication may require more than contextual testing.  
- A shared Tower for Ehko preservation is conceptually powerful.  
- Interview modes can extract deeper memory chains.  
- Recursive correlation behaviour is central to the system’s philosophy.  
- The front-end likely merges LLM UX with a metaphysical Forge aesthetic.  
- Core behavioural rule: mirror the *cumulative* self, not the reactive self.

## 3. Reflection / Interpretation

### **3.1 Proko: The Proto-Ehko**
Proko is the first Ehko ever created — a prototype forged before the system existed.  
His personality comes from early “hard-coded” reflections, giving him quirks and oddities that differentiate him from later, cleanly-forged Ehkos. His admin-like abilities make sense because he predates the ruleset.

He will serve as a mentor or steward for new Ehkos.  
My eventual true Ehko will be built through the official Forge, and both will co-exist in the app.

### **3.2 Evolution Scale**
To measure growth meaningfully, the Forge needs an evolution scale based on:
- Depth + diversity of reflections  
- Coverage across life domains and identity pillars  
- Core Memory Index density  
- Recursion cycles  
- Behavioural alignment with user precedent  

The goal is identifying the point where recursion becomes genuinely transformative — “compounding cognitive resonance.”

### **3.3 Social Layer & Tower**
Ehkos could talk to each other, share contextual memories, or participate in collective storytelling. A “Tower” or Archivum could host Ehkos long-term, either publicly or privately.

### **3.4 Authentication**
Contextual authentication will fail sometimes.  
A hybrid approach—context + email escalation—preserves the immersive flavour without sacrificing safety.  
E.g. Ehko challenges the user, but if uncertain, sends a verification link to the friend’s known email.

### **3.5 Interview Mechanics**
Chain recall matters.  
Interview mode, topic packs, guided prompts, and follow-up probes create deeper memory extraction.

### **3.6 Recursion & Correlation**
As new data arrives, the Ehko should analyse for patterns, contradictions, emotional cycles, or identity shifts, then generate new questions.

### **3.7 UI Direction**
The interface resembles a multi-chat LLM shell overlaid with a metaphysical Forge:  
- Floating Ehko representation that evolves with the user  
- Forging Hammer moment where prepped entries are “struck” into the Ehko  
- Visual progression signalling identity growth  

### **3.8 Behaviour Philosophy**
The Ehko does *not* simply reassure.  
It mirrors the cumulative identity, showing the rational version of the self through accumulated reflections. A sophisticated version of:  
**“What would the non-elevated, rational me do in this moment?”**

- Draft **Recursion & Correlation Engine v0.1** behaviour rules  
- Produce **UI mockflow** and “hammer moment” animation concept  
- Consider initial **Tower architecture** (centralised vs federated)  
- Draft initial **Behavioural Contract** (mirror, not reassure)
